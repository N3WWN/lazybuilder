# This will need to be a loop - I basically want to avoid having to have an
# entirely different set of tasks (eg mock.yml vs module.yml) - This should
# make things a bit more compact at the tasks root.
# TODO: Some module tasks should be done locally to be able to do multi-arch
#       builds. The basic idea is that if a build is being done, all applicable
#       arches should be done at the same time, if at all possible. There should
#       be a var that defines this and some other magic.
